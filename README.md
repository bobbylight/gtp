GTP - A very basic 2D HTML5 game library
========================================
This is a basic game library for 2D HTML5 games.  It is a WIP, and probably
isn't very useful to most people.

Features include:

* Input
* Audio
* Asset management (async loading of graphics, sounds, resources)
* Game states
* [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) map support
